Stormbringer Character Sheet
======================================

This character sheet is designed for ease of navigationâ€”everything is on one sheet, with a similar layout to the standard Stormbringer (4e? I found it online and the person requesting the sheet said it was the one he needed) character sheet.

Roll Buttons: There are no roll buttons currently, but I do have placeholders for them. If people would like them added, they can either modify the sheet themselves, or let me know what the formulas should be.

Customization: The Hit Points by Location section of the sheet can be customized slightly. The section can be shown or hidden. The image can be swapped between a slender person or a muscular person, and the ranges for each location can be modified. The Wounds Notes and Afflictions boxes will always show.
