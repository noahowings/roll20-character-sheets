There are no buttons at this time, but if someone can tell me where buttons should be placed and what the formulas are for those buttons, I'm happy to add them (I have placeholders for buttons on the Weapons lines as well as as for each skill).\r\r###Customization\rYou can customize the sheet by clicking on the little gear icon in the upper-left-hand corner of the sheet (under the logo). At the current time there are only a few things that can be customized:\r* **To show (or not show) the Hit Points by Location** roll\r* **The image of the person in the Hit Points by Location**\r* **The ranges for the Hit Points by Location**"
